## Description
This challenge is to understand and practice identifying semantic and non-semantic html and how it affect and reflects within the webpage and files that are associated with the webpages. 

I performed a code refactor for the webpage from non-semantic to semantic html and provided. This solved a nosemantic html code to be legible in a semantic format of html, which is provides labels for the code's structure and feature it produces. I learned the importance of semantic html terminolgy  that help produce a legible code for developers to analyze in their respected elements.
